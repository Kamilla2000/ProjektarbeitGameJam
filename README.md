## Description
In this charming and chaotic adventure, you step into the role of a divine being with an unusual mission: making sure a princess stays focused on her way to her wedding — while everyone around her keeps falling in love with her. Cupid, the mischievous god of love, is spreading chaos, turning peaceful forest paths into arenas of unwanted affection.

As the guardian of focus and reason, you must guide the princess through two engaging levels, each with unique mechanics and challenges. The world is filled with magical enemies, suitors, and distractions that you must fend off using heart-based powers like heart rain and healing messages.

Through item collection, dynamic life systems, and a stalking mechanic for persistent enemies, the gameplay becomes both strategic and narrative-driven. A free-look camera system lets you explore your surroundings, while immersive audio feedback – from collecting items to confronting enemies – enhances the entire experience.

Will you be able to block Cupid’s meddling ways and help the princess make it to the altar with her heart intact?
